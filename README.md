# Reactle with Practice Mode

This is a version of [Reactle](https://reactle.vercel.app/) with Practice Mode (a.k.a. infinite mode).

Practice mode lets you play an unlimited number of times, without affecting your daily statistics. It randomly serves a solution word each time it is refreshed. It can be toggled on and off in the Settings menu.
